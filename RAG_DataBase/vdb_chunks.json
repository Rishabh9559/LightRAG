Reflexology\nis a form of bodywork based on acupressure concepts.\nJin Shin Do is a bodywork technique with an increasing\nnumber of practitioners in America that combines acu-\npressure and shiatsu principles with qigong, Reichian\ntheory,and meditation.\nAcupressure and Chinese medicine\nChinese medicine views the body as a small part of\nthe universe,subject to laws and principles of harmony\nand balance. Chinese medicine does not make as sharp a\ndestinction as Western medicine does between mind and\nbody. The Chinese system believes that emotions and\nmental states are every bit as influential on disease as\npurely physical mechanisms,and considers factors like\nwork,environment,and relationships as fundamental to a\npatient’s health. Chinese medicine also uses very different\nsymbols and ideas to discuss the body and health. While\nWestern medicine typically describes health as mainly\nphysical processes composed of chemical equations and\nreactions,the Chinese use ideas like yin and yang,chi,\nand the organ system to describe health and the body.\nEverything in the universe has properties of yin and\nyang.
