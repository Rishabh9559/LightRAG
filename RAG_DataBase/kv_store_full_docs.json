Today,there are mil-\nlions of patients who attest to its effectiveness,and near-\nly 9,000 practitioners in all 50 states.\nAcupressure is practiced as a treatment by Chinese\nmedicine practitioners and acupuncturists,as well as by\nmassage therapists. Most massage schools in American\ninclude acupressure techniques as part of their bodywork\nprograms. Shiatsu massage is very closely related to acu-\npressure,working with the same points on the body and\nthe same general principles,although it was developed\nover centuries in Japan rather than in China. Reflexology\nis a form of bodywork based on acupressure concepts.\nJin Shin Do is a bodywork technique with an increasing\nnumber of practitioners in America that combines acu-\npressure and shiatsu principles with qigong, Reichian\ntheory,and meditation.\nAcupressure and Chinese medicine\nChinese medicine views the body as a small part of\nthe universe,subject to laws and principles of harmony\nand balance. Chinese medicine does not make as sharp a\ndestinction as Western medicine does between mind and\nbody. The Chinese system believes that emotions and\nmental states are every bit as influential on disease as\npurely physical mechanisms,and considers factors like\nwork,environment,and relationships as fundamental to a\npatient’s health. Chinese medicine also uses very different\nsymbols and ideas to discuss the body and health. While\nWestern medicine typically describes health as mainly\nphysical processes composed of chemical equations and\nreactions,the Chinese use ideas like yin and yang,chi,\nand the organ system to describe health and the body.\nEverything in the universe has properties of yin and\nyang. Yin is associated with cold,female,passive,down-\nward,inward,dark,wet. Yang can be described as hot,\nmale, active, upward, outward, light, dry, and so on.\nNothing is either completely yin or yang. These two prin-\nciples always interact and affect each other,although the\nbody and its organs can become imbalanced by having\neither too much or too little of either.\nChi (pronounced chee,also spelled qior kiin Japan-\nese shiatsu) is the fundamental life energy. It is found in\nfood,air,water,and sunlight,and it travels through the\nbody in channels called meridians.
