Chinese medicine does not make as sharp a\ndestinction as Western medicine does between mind and\nbody. The Chinese system believes that emotions and\nmental states are every bit as influential on disease as\npurely physical mechanisms,and considers factors like\nwork,environment,and relationships as fundamental to a\npatient’s health. Chinese medicine also uses very different\nsymbols and ideas to discuss the body and health. While\nWestern medicine typically describes health as mainly\nphysical processes composed of chemical equations and\nreactions,the Chinese use ideas like yin and yang,chi,\nand the organ system to describe health and the body.\nEverything in the universe has properties of yin and\nyang. Yin is associated with cold,female,passive,down-\nward,inward,dark,wet. Yang can be described as hot,\nmale, active, upward, outward, light, dry, and so on.\n######################\nOutput:"

Acne is usually not conspicuous, but inflamed lesions may cause pain, tenderness, itching, or swelling.\n*   **Diagnosis:** Acne patients are often treated by family doctors, with complicated cases referred to dermatologists or endocrinologists. Diagnosis involves a complete medical history and physical examination.\n*   **Treatment:** Acne treatment reduces sebum production, removes dead skin cells, and kills bacteria with topical and oral medications. Treatment depends on the severity of the acne.\n*   **Prevention:** There are no sure ways to prevent acne, but steps to minimize flare-ups include gentle washing, avoiding abrasive cleansers, using noncomedogenic makeup, shampooing often, eating a balanced diet, limiting sun exposure, avoiding picking blemishes, and reducing stress.\n\n### References\n*   [DC] unknown_source\n*   [DC] unknown_source\n*   [DC] unknown_source\n",

      "return": "Here's information about abdominal aorta ultrasounds based on the provided documents:\n\n### Definition\nAbdominal aorta ultrasound utilizes ultrasound technology to visualize the inside of a patient's abdomen without surgery. High-frequency sound waves are transmitted into the body, bouncing off tissues and organs to create echoes. These echoes are processed by a computer to form an image on a screen, allowing doctors to assess the abdominal aorta.\n\n### Purpose\nAbdominal aorta ultrasound is useful for identifying and monitoring abdominal aortic aneurysms, which are bulges in the aorta. Early identification and monitoring of aneurysms can prevent life-threatening complications.\n\n### Procedure\nDuring the procedure, a gel is applied to the patient's abdomen, and a probe is moved across the skin to transmit and receive ultrasonic pulses. The patient may be asked to change positions or hold their breath to optimize the views. The duration of the scan for a suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm is approximately half an hour.\n\n### Precautions\nAbdominal ultrasound is generally considered safe, with minimal risk or side effects. Some patients might feel slight tingling or warmth. However, the accuracy of the ultrasound depends on the quality of the equipment and the skill of the medical personnel.\n\n### Additional Information\nUltrasound technology can also be used for treatment purposes, most frequently as a visual aid during surgical procedures.\n\n### References\n* [DC] unknown_source\n* [DC] unknown_source\n* [DC] unknown_source\n* [DC] unknown_source\n",
